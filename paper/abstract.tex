%% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
The advent of cloud native applications and the increasing popularity of public cloud platforms raises a host of questions regarding the privacy of sensitive information.

However, the stateless nature of microservices running in a FaaS environment also presents an opportunity for designing secure applications.

This paper presents a framework for designing secure FaaS applications on top of Amazon Lambda. The security guarantees are backed by an Information Flow Control system that leverages the stateless nature of the FaaS microservices (Lambdas) to guarantee a secure execution with few false alarms and low runtime overheads.

Our system provides run-time guarantees of Progress Sensitive Non-Interference for FaaS application.
