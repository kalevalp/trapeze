\section{Model} % (fold)
\label{sec:model}

In this section we present a model for describing information flow in a transactional system.

\subsection{Computational Model} % (fold)
\label{sub:computational_model}
We begin by describing the non-IFC computational model.

Our model consists of a set of memory locations $M=\{m_1,\dots,m_n\}$, a memory access function $r: M \rightarrow D$, where $D$ is the domain of data in our system, and a set of computations $\mathcal{F} = \{f_1,\ldots,f_k\}$ where each copmutation $f_i$ is a function from a vector of data elements to a single data element $f_i:\overline{D} \rightarrow D$.

We define a \emph{transaction} operation that applies a given computation to the values stored in a vector of memory locations, and stores the result of the computation in another memory location. \TODO{Semantics for the transaction operation.}
